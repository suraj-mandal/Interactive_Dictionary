# INTERACTIVE DICTIONARY

A simple CUI interpretation of a dictionary in python using all the available words stored in the **data.json** file as a database shipped along with this module.

### FEATURES

1. Pattern guesser: Enter a word which is not present in the json file and the application will try to search for closest matches in the available repository of words in the database.

### INSTALLATION
1. Python :
    get the latest version from here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/

2. Any IDE you want: I have used pycharm-community edition. You can download it from here:
    https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

### MORE IMPROVEMENTS
1. The app can be scaled by including an even better repository of words in the json format. Make it your own by editing the json file.
